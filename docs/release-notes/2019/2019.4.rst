This version was released on TODO, 2019. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in GROMACS since the
previous 2019.3 version, to fix known issues. It also incorporates all
fixes made in version 2018.7 and earlier, which you can find described

.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on redmine, without the
   a space between the colon and number!

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix (unlikely) missing bonded forces with CUDA GPUs and domain decomposition
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Forces could be missing for bonded interactions computed on CUDA GPUs with
domain decomposition when there are non-local bonded interactions, but no
non-local non-bonded interactions between two domains. Note that this is
extremely unlikely to happen, since the distance between the bonded atoms
needs to be larger than the pair-list cut-off distance and there should be no
other non-local atoms within the pair-list cut-off distance.

:issue:`3063`

Fix segmentation fault in grompp and mdrun with cosine COM pulling
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`3023`


Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix bug in gmx xpm2ps
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The tool would fail when not being provided with a library file to read in.

:issue:`3012`

Fix bug in gmx anaeig
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

An issue was noted when reading a second set
set of eigenvectors that could lead to problems when the number
of eigenvectors was less than the three times the number of atoms.

:issue:`2972`

Fix issue with demux.pl script
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The trajectories could become discontinuous with simulations longer than 100ns
and exchange strides that are not a multiple of 1 ps. This only affected the
post-processing of trajectories generated from replica exchange simulations.

Made gmx disre work with non-consecutively labeled restraints
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`2953`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Disable PME OpenCL on Apple
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Apple OpenCL compilers fail to produce a functional clFFT build.
The OpenCL PME support is therefore disabled on Apple platforms.

:issue:`2941`

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
