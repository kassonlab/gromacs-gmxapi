                    resolved with the `result` methods on the result handles.

                    `run()` may be useful to try to trigger computation (such as for remotely
                    dispatched work) without retrieving results locally right away.

                    `run()` is also useful internally as a facade to the Context implementation details
                    that allow `result()` calls to ask for their data dependencies to be resolved.
                    Typically, `run()` will cause results to be published to subscribing operations as
                    they are calculated, so the `run()` hook allows execution dependency to be slightly
                    decoupled from data dependency, as well as to allow some optimizations or to allow
                    data flow to be resolved opportunistically. `result()` should not call `run()`
                    directly, but should cause the resource manager / Context implementation to process
                    the data flow graph.

                    In one conception, `run()` can have a return value that supports control flow
                    by itself being either runnable or not. The idea would be to support
                    fault tolerance, implementations that require multiple iterations / triggers
                    to complete, or looping operations.
