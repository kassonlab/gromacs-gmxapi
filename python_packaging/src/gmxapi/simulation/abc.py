Abstract base classes for gmxapi.simulation module
==================================================

These classes allow static and dynamic type checking for gmxapi Python
interfaces. Some may be used as bases to inherit behaviors, but users should
not assume that a gmxapi object actually inherits from classes in this module.

For more information on the concept of abstract base classes in Python, refer
to https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html

For more on type hinting, see https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html

    Acceptable simulation input includes:
        * TPR filename.
        * Output from read_tpr or modify_input.
        *
        * TODO: an acceptable collection of data sources.

    This class is intended for static and dynamic type checking, and to provide
    a documentation entry point for what is considered to be valid simulation
    input.

    No code should assume that input objects actually derive from this class.

    The output of ReadTpr and ModifyInput are examples of objects implementing
    SimulationInput compatible interfaces.
